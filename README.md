setup
=====

A personalized setup for `R`.  I've found it useful to add
`library(setup)` to my `.Rprofile`, maybe others will too.  Always
changing, never any goals for stabilization.  Current features:

1. utilities for processing parts of `knitr` chunks
2. alternative interface to `R`'s symbolic differentiation tools
3. sugar for interfacing with `bash`
4. sugar for using uniform distributions over subsets of the integers
